#California Housing Price Prediction â€” Machine Learning Project
#Overview
This project predicts housing prices in California districts based on features like location, income, and house characteristics.
The goal was to complete an end-to-end machine learning pipeline: from data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

This ML project focused on deep understanding rather than just results.

Dataset
Source: California Housing Dataset

Target: median_house_value

#What I Did
Handled missing data

Explored and visualized distributions

Created new features (rooms_per_house, people_per_house)

Built Linear Regression and Random Forest models

Compared models using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Analyzed feature importance

#Tech Stack
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

#Folder Structure

File/Folder	Description
housing_price_prediction.ipynb	   --   Jupyter Notebook containing full code and analysis
housing_price_prediction_report.md --	  Detailed project report summarizing the approach

#Highlights
Random Forest achieved the best performance.

Median income was found to be the strongest predictor of house prices.

Focused more on learning the ML pipeline deeply rather than just accuracy.

#Future Plans
Explore deploying this model after more projects.

Gradually move towards learning ML Ops practices like model tracking and deployment.

Note: This project is for learning purposes and understanding real-world ML workflows.
